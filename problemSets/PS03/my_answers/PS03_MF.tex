	\maketitle
	\section*{Instructions}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Please show your work! You may lose points by simply writing in the answer. If the problem requires you to execute commands in \texttt{R}, please include the code you used to get your answers. Please also include the \texttt{.R} file that contains your code. If you are not sure if work needs to be shown for a particular problem, please ask.
	\item Your homework should be submitted electronically on GitHub.
	\item This problem set is due before 23:59 on Sunday November 20, 2022. No late assignments will be accepted.
	\item Total available points for this homework is 80.
	\end{itemize}

		\vspace{.25cm}
	
\noindent In this problem set, you will run several regressions and create an add variable plot (see the lecture slides) in \texttt{R} using the \texttt{incumbents\_subset.csv} dataset. Include all of your code.

	\vspace{.5cm}
\section*{Question 1}
\vspace{.25cm}
\noindent We are interested in knowing how the difference in campaign spending between incumbent and challenger affects the incumbent's vote share. 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Run a regression where the outcome variable is \texttt{voteshare} and the explanatory variable is \texttt{difflog}.
		\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=9, lastline=10]{MF_PS03.R}	\vspace{5cm}
		\item Make a scatterplot of the two variables and add the regression line. 
		
		\vspace{1cm}
		\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Q1_Rplot.png}
		\vspace{2cm}
		\item Save the residuals of the model in a separate object.
			\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=17, lastline=17]{MF_PS03.R}	\vspace{5cm}
		\item Write the prediction equation.\vspace{1cm}
		
		\texttt{Y = 0.579031 + 0.041666(X)}
	\end{enumerate}
	
\newpage

\section*{Question 2}
\noindent We are interested in knowing how the difference between incumbent and challenger's spending and the vote share of the presidential candidate of the incumbent's party are related.	\vspace{.25cm}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Run a regression where the outcome variable is \texttt{presvote} and the explanatory variable is \texttt{difflog}.
		\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=28, lastline=29]{MF_PS03.R}	\vspace{1cm}
		\item Make a scatterplot of the two variables and add the regression line. 
		
		\vspace{1cm}
		\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Q2_Rplot.png}
		\vspace{1cm}
		\item Save the residuals of the model in a separate object.
		\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=36, lastline=36]{MF_PS03.R}	\vspace{1cm}
		\item Write the prediction equation.
		
		\texttt{Y = 0.507583 + 0.023837(X)}
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\newpage	
\section*{Question 3}

\noindent We are interested in knowing how the vote share of the presidential candidate of the incumbent's party is associated with the incumbent's electoral success.
	\vspace{.25cm}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Run a regression where the outcome variable is \texttt{voteshare} and the explanatory variable is \texttt{presvote}.
		\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=47, lastline=48]{MF_PS03.R}	
		\vspace{1cm}
		\item Make a scatterplot of the two variables and add the regression line. 
		
		\vspace{1cm}
		\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Q3_Rplot.png}
		\vspace{1cm}
		\item Write the prediction equation.
		
		\texttt{Y = 0.441330 + 0.388018(X)}
	\end{enumerate}
	

\newpage	
\section*{Question 4}
\noindent The residuals from part (a) tell us how much of the variation in \texttt{voteshare} is $not$ explained by the difference in spending between incumbent and challenger. The residuals in part (b) tell us how much of the variation in \texttt{presvote} is $not$ explained by the difference in spending between incumbent and challenger in the district.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Run a regression where the outcome variable is the residuals from Question 1 and the explanatory variable is the residuals from Question 2.	
		\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=63, lastline=64]{MF_PS03.R}	
		\vspace{1cm}
		\item Make a scatterplot of the two residuals and add the regression line. 
		
		\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Q4_Rplot.png}
		\vspace{1cm}
		\item Write the prediction equation.
		
		\texttt{Y = -1.674e-18 + 2.569e-01(X)}
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\newpage	

\section*{Question 5}
\noindent What if the incumbent's vote share is affected by both the president's popularity and the difference in spending between incumbent and challenger? 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Run a regression where the outcome variable is the incumbent's \texttt{voteshare} and the explanatory variables are \texttt{difflog} and \texttt{presvote}.
			\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=78, lastline=79]{MF_PS03.R}	
		\vspace{1cm}
		\item Write the prediction equation.
		
		\texttt{Y = 0.4486442 + 0.0355431($ X_{1} $) +  0.2568770($ X_{2} $)}	
		\vspace{3cm}
		\item What is it in this output that is identical to the output in Question 4? Why do you think this is the case?
		
		\texttt{The coefficient t value for presvote from Q5 is the same as the coefficient t value for resQ2 from Q4. This is because both coefficients are capturing the variation in presidential popularity that is not explained by difference in spending.}
	\end{enumerate}
